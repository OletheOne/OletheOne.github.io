                                This guide provides a streamlined <strong>step-by-step walkthrough</strong> to
                                complete Elden Ring as fast as possible <em>without</em> glitches or unintended
                                sequence breaks. We focus on an <strong>optimal high-DPS build (bleed-focused
                                Dexterity)</strong> that requires minimal setup, and we highlight early gear
                                that stays powerful through the late game. All major bosses and key
                                optional content are covered with efficient routing to minimize
                                backtracking. Follow along in parts, and use the tables and bullet
                                points for quick reference on leveling, gear, and boss order. Good luck,
                                Tarnished!

                            <h2 class="card__title">Optimal Build Overview -- "Bleed Samurai" (Dexterity/Arcane)</h2>
                            <p>
                                We will use a bleed-focused melee build for fast boss melts and adaptable
                                combat. The Samurai class is an ideal start (high Dex, comes with
                                Uchigatana). Prioritize <strong>Dexterity</strong> (damage scaling) and enough
                                <strong>Strength</strong> to wield weapons like the Bloodhound's Fang. Later, add
                                some <strong>Arcane</strong> to scale bleed weapons (e.g. Rivers of Blood). This
                                build achieves <strong>high DPS</strong> through bleed procs (percentage health
                                damage) and strong weapon skills, enabling quick kills on bosses and
                                tough mobs. We'll also invest in <strong>Vigor</strong> for survivability and a bit
                                of <strong>Faith</strong> to use two key buff spells (<em>Flame, Grant Me Strength</em> and
                                <em>Bloodflame Blade</em>) that further boost damage. Below is a summary of
                                stat progression:

                            <p>
                                <strong>Note:</strong> By Level ~25 you should have Str 18 and Dex 17 to wield the
                                Bloodhound's Fang greatsword. After that, pump Dexterity for damage,
                                with periodic boosts to Vigor (aim for 30+ by mid-game) and the small
                                Faith investment by Level 50. If you plan to use <strong>Rivers of Blood</strong>
                                katana (found in the Mountaintops), you'll need 20 Arcane -- you can
                                respec or allocate some points to Arc after Dex is high. Bleed's power
                                scales with Arcane, and the weapon skill <strong>Corpse Piler</strong> on Rivers of
                                Blood is devastating for both bosses and mobs. This build remains
                                extremely effective through the end of the game and into New Game+ due
                                to bleed's %HP damage.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Early Gear & Summons</h3>
                            <p>
                                We will grab powerful weapons and tools early:
                                the <strong>Uchigatana</strong> (starter weapon) for bleed, the <strong>Bloodhound's Fang</strong>
                                (high damage curved greatsword) in Limgrave, and later the <strong>Rivers of
                                Blood</strong> katana. Key early items include <strong>Radagon's Sorseal</strong> talisman
                                (boosts stats by +5), the <strong>Green Turtle Talisman</strong> (faster stamina
                                regen), and the <strong>Flask of Wondrous Physick</strong> (custom buff potion).
                                We'll also obtain spirit summons like the <strong>Lone Wolves/Jellyfish</strong>
                                (early game) and <strong>Mimic Tear</strong> (mid-game) to aid in tough fights. Ashes
                                of War such as <strong>Bloody Slash</strong> (adds bleed damage to weapons) and
                                <strong>Bloodhound's Step</strong> (for quick evasion) will further enhance our
                                combat efficiency.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Routing</h3>
                            <p>
                                The walkthrough is divided into parts following an optimal
                                boss order. We'll first tackle two mandatory <strong>Great Rune</strong> bosses
                                (Godrick and Rennala) to unlock Leyndell, then push through the capital
                                to endgame. Major optional areas (Caelid, Nokron, Volcano Manor,
                                Haligtree, etc.) are integrated at efficient points so you can
                                experience all major content without significant detours. <strong>If you wish
                                to skip optional content</strong> to save time, you can follow just the main
                                path sections (noted accordingly). However, even the optional segments
                                are structured to provide worthwhile rewards (e.g. weapons, runes,
                                summons) that make the main journey easier and faster overall.

                                <h4>Starting Class & Keepsake</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Select <strong>Samurai</strong> as your starting class
                                    for a strong Dexterity stat and the Uchigatana (a bleed katana that
                                    remains useful for a long time). For Keepsake, pick the <strong>Golden Seed</strong>
                                    (extra healing flask) -- this helps sustain you early. Alternatively, a
                                    <strong>Stonesword Key</strong> is useful to unlock imp-seal areas (we'll use one to
                                    get a good talisman early), but you can find keys later too. Upon
                                    beginning the game, you'll start at the <strong>Chapel of Anticipation</strong>.
                                    Fight the grafted Scion if you wish, but it's intended to kill you --
                                    don't worry if you die. After the prologue, you'll revive in
                                    <strong>Limgrave</strong>, the first open area.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In the <strong>Stranded Graveyard</strong>, head right
                                    into the pit to do the tutorial cave (optional but recommended if you're
                                    new). It teaches basics like guarding, dodge-rolling, and critical hits.
                                    Once done, exit into the open world of <strong>Limgrave</strong>. Immediately,
                                    prioritize these steps to get essential tools and power up quickly:
                                </p>

                                        <strong>Unlock Leveling and Your Horse "Torrent":</strong> Follow the guidance of
                                        grace (the golden light trail) to the <strong>Gatefront Ruins</strong> Site of Grace.
                                        Activate the grace and rest; you will meet <strong>Melina</strong> in a cutscene.
                                        Accept her accord to gain the ability to <strong>level up</strong> and the spectral
                                        steed <strong>Torrent</strong>. Torrent lets you traverse the world faster and escape
                                        danger. (If Melina doesn't appear at Gatefront, rest at another nearby
                                        grace like Agheel Lake North.)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Obtain the Spirit Summoning Bell:</strong> From Gatefront, backtrack at
                                        night to the <strong>Church of Elleh</strong> (the ruins with the merchant Kale). At
                                        night, a witch named <strong>Renna</strong> appears here -- talk to her and she will
                                        give you the <strong>Spirit Calling Bell</strong> and <strong>Lone Wolf Ashes</strong>, enabling
                                        spirit summoning. (If you miss Renna and she's gone, you can buy the
                                        bell later from the Twin Maiden Husks at Roundtable Hold, but getting it
                                        now is easiest.) Summons like the lone wolves can distract enemies and
                                        bosses, making fights more manageable.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Equip Your Weapon & Shield:</strong> The Samurai starts with a Longbow and
                                        katana. The Uchigatana's fast strikes and bleed buildup are excellent.
                                        Two-handing it (press Y/â–³ + RB/R1) will increase damage (and effectively
                                        let you meet higher strength requirements). You also have a shield --
                                        useful for blocking minor enemies, but try to rely on dodging and only
                                        block if needed since our build will focus on agility and offense.

                                        <strong>Grab the Crafting Kit and Map:</strong> Still at the Church of Elleh,
                                        purchase the <strong>Crafting Kit</strong> from Merchant Kale (300 runes) so you can
                                        craft basic items like arrows, bolts, and fire pots from collected
                                        materials. Also, pick up the <strong>Limgrave West Map Fragment</strong> at the stone
                                        stele along the road just south of Gatefront (marked on your mini-map).
                                        Map fragments reveal the area map and help navigation.

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Early Power Boost (Fort Faroth Route):</strong> Now we'll do an
                                        <strong>efficient early-game run</strong> to grab a great talisman and lots of runes.
                                        From Gatefront, ride Torrent east through Mistwood to the <strong>Third Church
                                        of Marika</strong> (northeast Limgrave). Inside, loot the <strong>Flask of Wondrous
                                        Physick</strong> and two crystal tears from the basin -- this flask lets you
                                        mix tears for custom buffs. (For now, mix the <strong>Crimson Crystal Tear</strong>
                                        for a big heal and the <strong>Strength-knot Tear</strong> for +10 Str for 3 minutes,
                                        which helps meet weapon requirements early.) Behind the church, there's
                                        a hidden gateway -- examine the glowing Sending Gate to teleport to
                                        <strong>Bestial Sanctum</strong> in Caelid.
                                        
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                You'll appear in Greyoll's Dragonbarrow (northeast Caelid), a
                                                high-level area, but we're just here to grab loot. Mount Torrent and
                                                <strong>avoid fighting</strong> (the giant gargoyle guard will ignore you if you run
                                                past). Head directly south along the path from Bestial Sanctum to find
                                                <strong>Fort Faroth</strong> (use your map -- it's southeast, across a bridge into
                                                the red swamp area). With Torrent, ride quickly, ignore enemies
                                                (including a giant dragon you might see in the distance), and reach Fort
                                                Faroth.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                In <strong>Fort Faroth</strong>, run inside past or through the bats (use a torch
                                                if needed -- it's dark). Climb the ladder on the right to the top of the
                                                fort. On the rooftop, loot the chest for the <strong>Dectus Medallion
                                                (Right)</strong> half. This will be crucial to access Altus Plateau later via
                                                the Grand Lift. Drop back down and carefully search the ground floor of
                                                the fort for a small corpse in a corner <em>guarded by giant bats</em>. On this
                                                corpse is <strong>Radagon's Sorseal</strong> -- a legendary talisman that <strong>raises
                                                Vigor, Endurance, Strength, and Dexterity by +5</strong> each, at the cost of
                                                taking slightly more damage. This trade-off is worth it to meet weapon
                                                stat requirements and boost damage early. Equip Radagon's Sorseal
                                                immediately for +20 levels worth of stats.

                                                <strong>(Optional Huge Rune Farm)</strong>: Outside Fort Faroth, an enormous
                                                sleeping dragon named <strong>Greyoll</strong> lies across the ground. She won't
                                                fight back. If you have a bleed weapon (your Uchigatana causes bleed),
                                                you can <strong>slay Greyoll for a massive 80,000 Rune reward</strong>. This can be
                                                tedious (she has very high HP). Trick: use bleed buildup to your
                                                advantage -- each bleed proc takes off a chunk of her health. It takes
                                                roughly 7--8 bleed procs to kill her, so whack away with the Uchigatana
                                                (two-hand it for more damage) until she dies. Use Torrent to hit and
                                                reposition if needed (her baby dragons might aggro, but you can avoid or
                                                outrun them). With Radagon's Sorseal boosting your strength and dex,
                                                you'll deal more damage and trigger bleed faster. Once Greyoll dies,
                                                <strong>you'll instantly gain around 5 level-ups worth of runes</strong> -- a huge
                                                head start. Spend these runes at a Site of Grace (Fort Faroth or
                                                teleport back to Third Church grace) to level up: get <strong>STR to 18</strong> and
                                                <strong>DEX to 17</strong> right away (if you haven't already) to meet weapon
                                                requirements. Put most remaining points into <strong>Vigor</strong> (aim for 20+),
                                                with some Endurance if you feel stamina is an issue. You can also pop
                                                any Golden Runes from your inventory for extra level-ups.

                                                or any grace in Limgrave. <em>(Note: If you have trouble surviving the

                                                You'll just need to gather runes via normal combat and maybe come back

                                                <strong>Fort Haight (Dectus Medallion Left):</strong> Head to <strong>Fort Haight</strong> on
                                                the southeast of Limgrave (east of Mistwood). Fight or run past the
                                                soldiers inside and climb the ladder to the chest at the top. Loot the
                                                <strong>Dectus Medallion (Left)</strong>. Now you have both halves of the Dectus
                                                Medallion, which later lets us skip a whole dungeon by using the Grand
                                                Lift of Dectus to Altus Plateau. Also defeat the fort's boss, Knight
                                                Darrell, if you want the Bloody Slash ash of war (a ranged bleed slash
                                                -- can be infused on a spare sword/katana for a strong special move).

                                                <strong>Mistwood: Meet Blaidd (for a Powerful Weapon):</strong> In the Mistwood
                                                (east Limgrave), you might hear a wolf howl near the ruins. Go to
                                                <strong>Mistwood Ruins</strong> and listen for the howling. Then fast-travel or run
                                                back to the Church of Elleh and tell Kale about the howl. He'll teach
                                                you the <strong>"Finger Snap"</strong> gesture. Return to Mistwood Ruins and use
                                                Finger Snap when you hear the howl -- <strong>Blaidd</strong>, the Half-Wolf NPC,
                                                will jump down from the tower. Talk to him; he's looking for a blood
                                                knight named Darriwil. Exhaust his dialogue. <em>(This triggers Blaidd's

                                                <strong>Forlorn Hound Evergaol (Bloodhound's Fang):</strong> Just south of Mistwood
                                                (near the Bridge of Sacrifice leading to Weeping Peninsula) is the
                                                <strong>Forlorn Hound Evergaol</strong> -- a circular stone platform. Prepare for a
                                                fight and <strong>enter the Evergaol</strong>. Inside, you'll face <strong>Bloodhound
                                                Knight Darriwil</strong>, a fast-moving boss. Fortunately, since you freed
                                                Blaidd, you can summon him here: look for a gold summon sign on the
                                                ground and use it to call <strong>Blaidd</strong> to help. With Blaidd tanking and
                                                your now-buffed stats, Darriwil should go down quickly. Time your dodges
                                                against his lunges, and use a few heavy hits or Bloody Slash if you have
                                                it. Defeating Darriwil grants you <strong>Bloodhound's Fang</strong>, one of the best
                                                early-game weapons! This curved greatsword has high base damage, scales
                                                with STR/DEX, causes bleed, and its special skill <strong>Bloodhound's
                                                Finesse</strong> lets you hit and flip away safely. It will carry you through a
                                                large portion of the game. Equip it two-handed (requires 18 STR, 17 DEX
                                                -- which we have or are very close to). If you're just shy of
                                                requirements, level up or use the Strength-knot Physick to temporarily
                                                meet STR. After the fight, Blaidd thanks you and leaves (he gives you a
                                                Somber Smithing Stone [2], useful for upgrading the Fang).

                                                upgrade it. Return to <strong>Table of Lost Grace (Roundtable Hold)</strong> --
                                                Melina may have already invited you after you visited a few graces or
                                                defeated Margit (if not yet, you can actually access Roundtable early by
                                                fast-traveling: open map and select the Table of Lost Grace icon once it
                                                appears). At Roundtable, talk to blacksmith <strong>Smithing Master Hewg</strong>.
                                                You'll need Somber Smithing Stones to upgrade special weapons like BHF.
                                                You have a [2] from Blaidd; the [1] can be found in Limgrave (e.g.,
                                                one is in the Limgrave Tunnels or near the beach by Coastal Cave). If
                                                you have them, get BHF to +2. Also upgrade your Uchigatana to +3 (using
                                                normal Smithing Stones) if you plan to dual-wield it or use it
                                                situationally. If short on stones, explore Limgrave caves like
                                                <strong>Limgrave Tunnels</strong> (near Agheel Lake north) which has many smithing
                                                stones.

                                                <strong>Summonwater Village (Green Turtle Talisman):</strong> In east Limgrave,
                                                near where you met D, there's <strong>Summonwater Village</strong> (a ruins overrun
                                                by undead). In the village, use a Stonesword Key on the imp statue to
                                                open a cellar. Inside, loot the <strong>Green Turtle Talisman</strong> from a chest.
                                                This talisman vastly improves stamina recovery -- great for relentless
                                                attacking with heavy weapons. It's a perfect complement to our build, so
                                                equip it (it stacks nicely with endurance and lets you spam dodge or
                                                attacks more freely).

                                                <strong>Murkwater Cave (Margit's Shackle & Patches):</strong> In the Murkwater
                                                River ravine (north of Agheel Lake), you'll get invaded by <strong>Bloody
                                                Finger Nerijus</strong> as you go deeper. Defeat him (Blaidd may show up to
                                                assist here as well). You'll receive <strong>Reduvia</strong>, a dagger that causes
                                                bleed rapidly with its skill -- keep it as a backup or for fun (it
                                                requires a bit of Arcane to use its skill). Continue north to
                                                <strong>Murkwater Cave</strong>. Inside is <strong>Patches</strong>, a NPC invader turned
                                                merchant. Open the chest to trigger a boss fight with Patches -- get him
                                                to half health and he'll surrender. <em>Do NOT kill him.</em> When he yields,
                                                stop attacking and the fight ends. Rest at the grace in his cave and
                                                talk to him -- he sets up shop. Importantly, buy <strong>Margit's Shackle</strong>
                                                from Patches (cost ~5,000 runes). This reusable item can <strong>freeze
                                                Margit (and later Morgott) in place for a brief time, twice per fight</strong>
                                                -- a huge help for those battles. Also consider buying a <strong>Stonesword
                                                Key</strong> if you used yours, as more will be handy later. <em>(If you're short
                                                on runes, you can farm a few soldiers or use some Golden Rune
                                                consumables. Investing in Margit's Shackle is worth it.)</em>

                                                things there: another Sacred Tear at the Church of Pilgrimage, a Golden
                                                Seed by the Minor Erdtree, the <strong>Opaline Bubbletear</strong> (in the minor
                                                Erdtree boss, gives a Physick mix effect that negates 90% of the next
                                                hit -- very useful for bosses) , and <strong>Castle Morne</strong> at the far south
                                                (boss there drops a rare greatsword, but it's optional). Weeping is not
                                                required, but if Margit is giving you trouble, the extra XP and tears
                                                can help. That said, with our current loadout (BHF +2, Sorseal, good
                                                talismans, wolves summon, etc.), we're ready to take on Margit
                                                directly.

                                    When ready, head to Stormveil. Approach the main gate up the Stormhill
                                    path. <strong>Margit, the Fell Omen</strong> will ambush you on the cliffside before
                                    the gate. This is your first major boss test. Make sure you have
                                    <strong>Margit's Shackle</strong> on a quick item slot and <strong>Lone Wolves (or
                                    Jellyfish)</strong> equipped as your summon. Also, use your Wondrous Physick
                                    flask (mix a healing tear + strength or stamina regen for example) just
                                    before entering the fog gate for buffs.

                                        <strong>Boss: Margit, the Fell Omen:</strong> Margit is fast and hits hard, but
                                        he's vulnerable to being staggered and to bleed. Summon <strong>Sorcerer
                                        Rogier</strong> just outside the boss fog (his sign appears on the ground if
                                        you're online, or offline if you met him earlier -- not mandatory, but
                                        he can distract Margit). Enter, and immediately use <strong>Margit's Shackle</strong>
                                        to slam him down. Get in a couple free heavy hits with Bloodhound's
                                        Fang. Your spirit wolves (or other ash) will appear and harass him too.
                                        In the first phase, whenever Margit is about to do a big combo, you can
                                        use the Shackle again to interrupt (it works twice in the first 50% of
                                        his health). The Bloodhound's Fang's weapon skill is excellent here: use
                                        <strong>L2 + R2</strong> to perform a lunging upward slash then flip back -- it does
                                        great damage and lets you evade counterattacks. With bleed procs and
                                        BHF's damage, Margit's health will drop quickly. At ~60% HP he'll start
                                        using a glowing hammer and knives. Stay behind him as much as possible,
                                        and roll through his hammer slam attacks to punish. If you're unsure,
                                        <strong>play defensively</strong> -- block or dodge until you see a long recovery,
                                        then hit him. His tail swipe can surprise you if you stick too close in
                                        front, so try to circle. <strong>Tip:</strong> You can <strong>summon your wolves</strong> (or
                                        other spirit) as soon as you enter to divert Margit's attention. With
                                        summon + Rogier/Blaidd (if present) + Shackle usage, Margit can be
                                        overwhelmed easily. Don't get greedy; heal when needed (his combos can
                                        two-shot you if Vigor ~20). Eventually, he'll fall. Congrats -- Margit
                                        is down!

                                        After victory, activate the <strong>Castleward Tunnel Site of Grace</strong>. A
                                        finger reader NPC will congratulate you. Proceed into Stormveil Castle.
                                        You have two path options: the <strong>main gate</strong> (tough, swarming with
                                        ballista fire) or the <strong>side path</strong>. Speak to <strong>Gatekeeper Gostoc</strong> just
                                        inside -- if you <strong>refuse to open the main gate</strong>, he'll suggest the
                                        side path (which is recommended). Go left around the castle wall via a
                                        narrow ledge. This leads you into the castle courtyard side entrance.
                                        Work your way upward through towers and ramparts. Stormveil is a large
                                        area with many items; for this speed run, focus on reaching the top, but
                                        consider grabbing a few <strong>useful items/gear</strong> along the way:
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Claw Talisman:</strong> From the Rampart Tower grace, head out onto the
                                        rooftops, dispatch a few birds, and find a ladder up a tower. At the
                                        top, in a chest, is the Claw Talisman (boosts jump attack damage). Since
                                        jump attacks with heavy weapons are very strong for stance-breaking,
                                        this talisman is great if you like that style.

                                        <strong>Godrick Soldier Ashes:</strong> In a cellar guarded by rats (near a
                                        courtyard with explosive barrels and fire throwers) you can find this
                                        summon ash. They're decent early on if you want a group summon.

                                        room with hanging bodies) find this key item. Give it later to
                                        <strong>Roderika</strong> (she's the young woman at <strong>Stormhill Shack</strong> you met on
                                        the way to the castle) when you see her at Roundtable -- it will
                                        convince her to become the spirit tuner so you can upgrade your ashes
                                        later.

                                        <strong>Meet Nepheli Loux:</strong> In a room before Godrick (downstairs from his
                                        fog gate courtyard), Nepheli is an NPC summon option for Godrick. Talk
                                        to her to get her summon sign to appear for the boss.

                                        <strong>Boss: Godrick the Grafted (Shardbearer #1):</strong> At the Secluded Cell
                                        grace, prepare for the fight. Use a Rune Arc if you want to activate
                                        Godrick's Great Rune <em>after</em> winning (you likely don't have any Great
                                        Runes yet, so skip for now). Summon <strong>Nepheli Loux</strong> outside the boss
                                        fog if you spoke to her. She can tank some of Godrick's hits. Enter and
                                        summon your spirit (if you have a strong +2 or +3 Jellyfish or wolves,
                                        they help distract). Godrick has many arms and wide attacks but is quite
                                        slow. Get behind him and unleash charged heavy attacks or weapon skills.
                                        <strong>Bloodhound's Fang</strong> deals massive damage; its bleed will chunk
                                        Godrick's large health pool. When he roars wind, back off to avoid the
                                        whirlwinds. At ~60% HP, a cutscene plays -- Godrick grafts a dragon
                                        head onto his arm and gains new fire attacks. In phase 2, stay medium
                                        range; when he breathes fire, get behind or far to punish. Use
                                        <strong>pillars</strong> in the arena to break his line of fire. Nepheli and your
                                        summon will hopefully still be harassing him. Keep up your offense --
                                        each bleed proc shaves off a big portion of his life. Jump attacks can
                                        stagger him for a critical hit opportunity. With aggressive play,
                                        Godrick will fall fairly quickly (this fight is easier than Margit for
                                        many). Dodge the final flurry and finish him off. <strong>Godrick's Great
                                        Rune</strong> and <strong>Remembrance of Godrick</strong> are your rewards. <em>Well done --
                                        you have defeated your first demigod!</em>

                                        <strong>Activating Godrick's Great Rune:</strong> This rune can be equipped (at a
                                        Site of Grace menu) to grant a massive stat boost (+5 to all stats) when
                                        active. To activate it, you must take it to the <strong>Divine Tower of
                                        Limgrave</strong>. From Stormveil's courtyard, exit via the back door past
                                        Godrick's arena and cross the bridge to the divine tower. Climb to the
                                        top and touch the glowing sigil to power the rune. Now you can equip
                                        Godrick's Great Rune. Use a <strong>Rune Arc</strong> to activate its effect, which
                                        lasts until death. It's very strong (especially combined with Radagon's
                                        Sorseal, that's +10 to your main stats effectively). Consider using a
                                        Rune Arc before tough fights for a big edge.

                                        <strong>Roundtable Hold:</strong> After Godrick is defeated, Melina will invite you
                                        (if not done already) to Roundtable Hold when you rest at a grace. At
                                        Roundtable, you can now speak to <strong>Finger Reader Enia</strong> who lets you
                                        trade Godrick's Remembrance for a boss weapon (Axe of Godrick or Grafted
                                        Dragon). You can also save the Remembrance to duplicate later or consume
                                        for runes. Our build doesn't need those weapons, so feel free to consume
                                        it for 20k runes if you want some easy levels.

                                    From here, your next main destination is <strong>Liurnia of the Lakes</strong> (north
                                    of Stormveil). If you exited via the main gate, you'll find yourself at
                                    <strong>Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace</strong> overlooking Liurnia. Part 1 covered
                                    a lot: you should be roughly level 30-40 with a +2-+4 Bloodhound's
                                    Fang, Uchigatana, some good talismans, and upgraded flasks (don't forget
                                    to use Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears you found to increase flask uses +
                                    potency). You're well-equipped to tackle the challenges ahead. Onward to

                                    Liurnia is a sprawling lake region. Our primary goal here is to obtain
                                    the second Great Rune by defeating <strong>Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon</strong>
                                    at Raya Lucaria Academy. We'll also take efficient side steps to set up
                                    key questlines and grab useful loot. By the end of this part, you'll
                                    have another major boss down, access to respecialization (rebirth), and
                                    progress toward some secret areas.

                                        <strong>Find the Map & Reach the Lake:</strong> From the cliff grace after
                                        Stormveil, follow the path down into <strong>Liurnia Lake</strong>. Grab the
                                        <strong>Liurnia East map fragment</strong> from the guide stele along the main road.
                                        The vast shallow lake is filled with ruins, enemy camps, and crab
                                        monsters. You can summon Torrent to ride across the water quickly. Head
                                        west toward the large cluster of ruins in the lake's center (Liurnia
                                        Highway North grace area). Your destination is the <strong>Academy Gate Town</strong>
                                        in the lake's southwest -- but without a key, we can't enter yet.

                                        <strong>Unlocking Raya Lucaria Academy:</strong> First, you need the <strong>Academy
                                        Glintstone Key</strong>. Go to the small island directly west of the academy's
                                        south gate. There's a Site of Grace called <strong>Temple Quarter</strong> nearby.
                                        Just west of that grace you'll see the sleeping <strong>Glintstone Dragon
                                        Smarag</strong> guarding a corpse. On that corpse is the <strong>Academy Key</strong>. You
                                        do <em>not</em> need to fight the dragon -- you can sneak around or sprint in,
                                        loot the key, and get out (Torrent helps). If the dragon wakes, just
                                        gallop off; you can return to the grace to lose aggro. Now with the key
                                        in hand, go to the <strong>South Raya Lucaria Gate</strong> (there's a grace there).
                                        Examine the seal and use the key to gain entry. This teleports you
                                        inside the academy.

                                                casting sorceries. Dodge its lunges and sword-like glintblade attacks.
                                                Your Bloodhound's Fang can take it down in a few hits (bleed is very
                                                effective on it). Summon wolves or any ash if you need distraction.
                                                Defeat the Red Wolf, rest at <strong>Debate Parlor Site of Grace</strong> beyond its
                                                room.

                                                From the Debate Parlor, head outside into the courtyard. To your
                                                right, you can climb debris to reach a rooftop. In a chest on a balcony
                                                here is the <strong>Glintstone Whetblade</strong> (allows you to put Magic or Frost
                                                affinity on weapons when infusing -- not needed for us unless you want a
                                                Frost Uchigatana). Also on a chandelier above the church, you can drop
                                                down to get the <strong>Radagon Icon</strong> talisman (shortens spell cast time --
                                                useful if you use any sorceries later).

                                                Climb the ladder on the west side, continue upward through the rotating
                                                staircases with marionette soldiers shooting at you. Push through to the
                                                top. Eventually you'll reach a lift that takes you to the <strong>Queen's
                                                Audience Chamber</strong> (Rennala's boss room). Before entering, prepare buffs
                                                (you can summon spirit ashes <em>during</em> the fight's second phase using a
                                                Summoning Pool sign inside).

                                        <strong>Boss: Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (Shardbearer #2):</strong> Rennala's
                                        fight has two phases:
                                        
                                        <ul>

                                                <strong>Phase 1 (Egg Chamber):</strong> Rennala is protected by a golden shield and
                                                a host of chanting student minions. You must break the glowing aura of 3
                                                specific chanting scholars (they're the ones with a golden glow around
                                                their bodies and who fling books). They hide among the many crawling
                                                students. Run around, smash the glowing students (one hit will break
                                                each one's glow and cause a section of the chandelier to fall). After
                                                you break three, Rennala's shield breaks and she falls to the ground.
                                                Rush in and hit her hard -- you can get 5-10 seconds of free damage.
                                                She's very weak to physical damage; you can take ~40-50% of her health
                                                in one cycle with Bloodhound's Fang. When she begins floating again,
                                                back off as the shield reforms. Repeat this (dodge or kill aggressive
                                                minions as needed) -- usually two cycles will push her to phase 2.

                                                <strong>Phase 2 (Full Moon Queen):</strong> Now you're teleported to a dark lake
                                                arena. Rennala will fight you directly with powerful sorceries.
                                                Immediately on phase start, <strong>summon your spirit ashes</strong> (if you have a
                                                strong one like a upgraded Lone Wolf or the Godrick Soldiers, they
                                                help). Dodge the initial beam or moon attack she casts. Close the gap
                                                quickly -- rolling left or right tends to evade her spells. <strong>Bleed
                                                works extremely well</strong> on Rennala's relatively low HP. Unleash jump
                                                attacks or weapon skills when you're in melee range; stagger her out of
                                                casting if possible. She will periodically summon spirits (like wolves,
                                                a giant, even a dragon). These summons are distractions -- you can
                                                ignore them mostly and keep pressuring Rennala, as they disappear after
                                                a short time. Keep an eye out for her massive <strong>Full Moon</strong> spell --
                                                she'll hover and summon a moon orb; sprint or roll away to avoid the
                                                explosion. Stay on her; each bleed proc will chunk her health. With your
                                                damage output, she should go down quickly. She has low poise, so she
                                                might not even get many spells off if you're aggressive. Defeat Rennala
                                                to claim her <strong>Great Rune of the Unborn</strong> (used for rebirth, not
                                                equippable for power) and <strong>Remembrance of Rennala</strong>.

                                                build. For now, you likely don't need to (we planned our build well),
                                                but keep in mind you have this option if later you want to reallocate
                                                stats (for example, to shift some Dex into Arcane for a weapon, or try
                                                out an Intelligence build).

                                    At this point, you have two Great Runes (Godrick's and Rennala's).
                                    <strong>Leyndell, the Royal Capital</strong> is now accessible, since the two-rune
                                    requirement is met. The main story path will have us go there next to
                                    face Morgott. However, <strong>Liurnia offers some important side content</strong>
                                    that's efficient to tackle now (or soon) and will enhance your strength
                                    for the late-game. We'll cover those briefly:

                                        doesn't need activation at a tower -- it simply enables rebirth. So
                                        nothing needed here.

                                        <strong>Ranni's Quest (Optional, Start Now):</strong> This is a major questline
                                        that leads to an alternate ending and unlocks <strong>Nokron</strong> and other
                                        secret areas. It's also the path to getting the <strong>Dark Moon Greatsword</strong>
                                        and arguably the best spirit summon <strong>Black Knife Tiche</strong>. Even if you
                                        don't plan to finish it now, it's efficient to <em>start</em> it. To do so,
                                        travel to <strong>Caria Manor</strong> in northwest Liurnia (the path north of the
                                        Academy). Fight through the hand spider enemies and reach the boss
                                        <strong>Royal Knight Loretta</strong>. Defeat Loretta (dodge her sorcery and hit her
                                        with bleed -- she's not too bad). This opens access to the <strong>Three
                                        Sisters</strong> area behind the manor. Go to <strong>Ranni's Rise</strong> (the middle
                                        tower) and speak to <strong>Ranni</strong> (she calls herself Renna here). Agree to
                                        serve her. Talk to her three retainers downstairs (Blaidd, Iji, Seluvis)
                                        then speak to Ranni again to conclude introductions. This initiates
                                        Ranni's quest. (Blaidd mentions he'll search for a way into Nokron, the
                                        Eternal City, hinting that something must happen to make Nokron
                                        accessible... that something is killing Radahn, which we'll do soon.)

                                        <strong>Haligtree Secret Medallion (Left Half):</strong> While in Liurnia, you can
                                        snag an item crucial for a late-game secret area. Go to the far
                                        southwest corner of Liurnia's swamp, past the Village of the Albinaurics
                                        (you can reach it by heading south from the lake, then up a slope). In
                                        the village (by the big pot creature), there's an illusory pot NPC named
                                        <strong>Albus</strong> hiding as a pot -- hit the pot to reveal him. Talk to Albus
                                        and he will give you the <strong>Haligtree Secret Medallion (Left)</strong>. (This
                                        medallion's two halves together grant access to a secret lift route to
                                        the Consecrated Snowfield -- we'll get the other half later in the
                                        Mountaintops. It's for the optional Haligtree/Malenia area. Grabbing
                                        this now saves a trip later.)

                                        <strong>Varre's Quest (Optional for Mohg's Palace):</strong> If you wish to access
                                        <strong>Mohgwyn Palace</strong> (optional high-level area, Mohg boss) earlier, you
                                        can continue <strong>White-Faced Varre's</strong> quest. After you first met him at
                                        Limgrave, he moves to the <strong>Rose Church</strong> in Liurnia (an island south of
                                        Raya Lucaria). Talk to him there -- he'll give you Festering Bloody
                                        Fingers and ask you to invade other players 3 times. You can do this
                                        offline (they don't need to be successful wins). After 3 invasions, talk
                                        to Varre again. He'll then ask you to soak a cloth in maiden's blood.
                                        The easiest maiden corpse is at the <strong>Church of Inhibition</strong> in
                                        northeast Liurnia (be careful of the Madness tower on the way; approach
                                        from behind the plateau). At the church, touch the dead maiden and use
                                        the cloth. Return to Varre, and he rewards you with the <strong>Pureblood
                                        Knight's Medal</strong>, a reusable item that teleports you to Mohgwyn Palace
                                        later. (He also gives you a reusable Bloody Finger for PvP.) We won't go
                                        to Mohgwyn just yet (too high-level now), but having this means you
                                        don't need to find the portal later. Keep it for when we tackle Mohg.

                                </ul>

                                    At this stage, you should be around <strong>Level 50-60</strong>. Make sure your
                                    <strong>Vigor</strong> is at least 30 (for survivability in the tougher zones ahead),
                                    and pump <strong>Dexterity</strong> toward 40+. With Godrick's Great Rune active (if
                                    you choose to use a Rune Arc), your stats will be even higher.
                                    <strong>Bloodhound's Fang +4 or +5</strong> should be achievable by now (if you found
                                    somber stones in Liurnia; the Twin Maiden Husks at Roundtable also sell
                                    unlimited somber [1] and [2] if you gave them Smithing Miner's Bell
                                    Bearing [1] from Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel, for example). Also
                                    consider upgrading a secondary weapon -- the <strong>Uchigatana</strong> with a Blood
                                    affinity (if you picked up a Whetstone Knife and Blood Ashes like Bloody
                                    Slash) to scale with Arcane for bleed, or even a <strong>second Uchigatana</strong>
                                    if you got one from Deathtouched Catacombs in Limgrave (dual-wielding
                                    two katanas can proc bleed extremely fast). However, BHF's raw damage is
                                    usually enough.
                                </p>

                                    We are now ready to travel to the Altus Plateau and the royal capital
                                    <strong>Leyndell</strong>, where the next main storyline boss (Morgott) awaits.
                                    Before that, we have one more major shardbearer boss optionally
                                    available: <strong>General Radahn</strong> in Caelid. In Part 3, we'll cover Caelid
                                    and the Radahn fight (which unlocks Nokron and leads to even more
                                    powerful gear like the Mimic Tear summon). If you choose to skip Radahn
                                    for now, you can proceed directly to Part 4 for Altus Plateau and
                                    Leyndell. Otherwise, let's dive into Caelid's crimson wastes.

                                <p>
                                    <em>(Part 3 is an optional but highly recommended detour through Caelid.
                                    We'll defeat <strong>Starscourge Radahn</strong>, an optional shardbearer whose
                                    death triggers new areas (Nokron) and yields a powerful Great Rune. This
                                    part also covers obtaining the <strong>Mimic Tear</strong> spirit ash -- one of
                                    the best summons -- and other valuable items. If you prefer to focus
                                    only on the critical path, you may skip to Part 4, but you'll miss out on
                                    gear that can make the late game easier.)</em>
                                </p>
                                
                                <h4>Travel to Caelid</h4>
                                <p>
                                    From Liurnia or Limgrave, head into <strong>Caelid</strong>
                                    (the region east of Limgrave). If you did the teleport to Bestial
                                    Sanctum earlier, you already visited a chunk of it. The fastest way to
                                    reach Radahn is to go to <strong>Redmane Castle</strong> in southeast Caelid. You can
                                    ride there from central Caelid (past the Smoldering Wall grace and south-east across the plains, then south of the Impassable Greatbridge).
                                    Alternatively, use the <strong>Teleport waypoint</strong> at the Impassable
                                    Greatbridge (the broken bridge near Caelid's southern edge has a sending
                                    gate that ports you into Redmane Castle). By now (post-Godrick and
                                    Rennala), you'll find Redmane Castle largely empty of enemies and
                                    hosting the <strong>Radahn Festival</strong>. Several NPCs (Alexander the jar
                                    warrior, Blythe/Blaidd, etc.) gather here if you met them. Activate the
                                    Site of Grace and talk to <strong>Jerren</strong> (the castle announcer) atop the
                                    stairs to initiate the festival. Tell him you're ready to fight Radahn,
                                    and the lifts will take you down to a portal that leads to Radahn's boss
                                    arena on the Wailing Dunes.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h4>Boss: Starscourge Radahn (Shardbearer, optional)</h4>
                                <p>
                                    This is an epic battle in a wide-open battlefield. Radahn is extremely tough if fought
                                    straight up, but the game gives you a trick: <strong>summon a small army of NPC allies</strong> scattered throughout the arena. Here's how to handle it efficiently:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Preparation:</strong> Ideally be Level ~60+. Use a Physick mix with
                                        <strong>Opaline Bubbletear</strong> (if you got it from Weeping Peninsula) to absorb
                                        a big hit, and maybe a strength or dex tear. Equip a bow if you have
                                        (for phase transitions). Radahn is susceptible to <strong>bleed and frost</strong>.
                                        If you acquired another Uchigatana, you could dual-wield with
                                        Bloodhound's Fang or use a Cold Uchi to apply frost -- but Bloodhound's
                                        Fang alone is fine. Consider using <strong>Torrent</strong> in this fight for
                                        mobility.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Phase 1:</strong> When you enter the dunes, Radahn will rain giant gravity
                                        arrows at you from afar. Immediately you'll see golden summon signs
                                        around -- <strong>summon every ally</strong> you find (Blaidd, Alexander, Okina,
                                        Finger Maiden, etc.). Use the ruins to block arrow shots as you do
                                        this. Each summon you activate will run at Radahn and draw aggro. Mount
                                        Torrent and zigzag toward Radahn, grabbing more summon signs on the way.
                                        With multiple NPCs attacking, Radahn's attention will split. Feel free
                                        to also fire a few arrows or spells at him while closing the distance,
                                        but be ready to dodge his large arrows (when he draws his bow high,
                                        zigzag or hide behind a ruin).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Once close, Radahn engages with massive curved swords. Dismount
                                        (fighting on foot can be easier to dodge his swings). <strong>Stay behind
                                        Radahn</strong> as much as possible -- his attacks are mostly forward sweeping.
                                        While your NPC friends distract him, whack at his legs. <strong>Bleed</strong> will
                                        chunk his enormous health for ~13% each proc, so it's very effective.
                                        Use <strong>Bloodhound's Finesse</strong> skill to hit and evade if Radahn turns on
                                        you. You can also fight on horseback, charging in hit-and-run attacks,
                                        but be cautious of his hitbox.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Radahn will likely kill your summons swiftly (he's very strong).
                                        <strong>Keep re-summoning fallen allies</strong>: their signs reappear on the ground
                                        after they fall. Ride around and re-click their signs to bring them
                                        back into the fight -- this is key, you can endlessly resummon allies to
                                        keep Radahn occupied. It's a hectic battlefield, but use the
                                        distraction to get your damage in.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Phase 2:</strong> At ~50% HP, Radahn leaps into the sky and disappears.
                                        Watch the sky -- after several seconds, he <em>meteors</em> back down in a
                                        flaming comet! This can one-shot if it lands on you, so when he
                                        vanishes, <strong>hop on Torrent and sprint horizontally</strong> to avoid the impact
                                        zone (or watch the sky and time a well-placed dodge at the last second).
                                        He'll come crashing down with a huge shockwave. After this, Radahn gains
                                        new gravity magic attacks (purple homing soul masses and huge gravity
                                        pulls). Keep summoning allies as they become available and dodge the
                                        homing projectiles (ride far to outrun them or if on foot, zigzag). If
                                        you see Radahn raise his swords and gravitational energy surges, back
                                        off or prepare to jump -- he can do a vacuum pull and explosive blast.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Meanwhile, your strategy remains: let summons grab aggro, then attack
                                        Radahn's flank. Use Torrent to quickly close distance or reposition if
                                        needed. Don't stay locked on -- manual camera might help to keep
                                        awareness of incoming glint projectiles. Radahn's swings in phase 2 are
                                        more aggressive, but still avoidable by rolling into them or around
                                        him.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        With continuous pressure from you and your NPC army, Radahn will
                                        eventually fall. This fight can be chaotic, but remember you can <strong>play
                                        it safe by staying on Torrent and only striking when he's busy</strong>. In
                                        fact, an ultra-safe (if cheesy) method is to just gallop around
                                        re-summoning NPCs and let them do most of the work while you avoid
                                        combat. It's not honorable, but it works -- and Radahn might even die
                                        without you directly engaging much if the NPCs get enough hits in while
                                        you keep them coming.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Defeating Radahn rewards the <strong>Remembrance of the Starscourge</strong> and
                                    <strong>Radahn's Great Rune</strong>. His Great Rune, once activated at the Divine
                                    Tower of Caelid (the one by Bestial Sanctum), grants a massive +15% max
                                    HP, +12% stamina, +5% FP boost when activated -- very strong for general
                                    usage. (You can stick with Godrick's for balanced stat increases, or
                                    Radahn's for a big health pool -- your choice.)
                                </p>

                                    Most dramatically, Radahn's defeat triggers a falling star that crashes
                                    into Limgrave, opening a path to <strong>Nokron, the Eternal City</strong>. A
                                    cutscene shows a star plummeting -- that impact site is in the Mistwood
                                    in Limgrave (south of Fort Haight). We'll go there next.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If you helped <strong>Alexander</strong> the Iron Jar (met at Radahn's fight or
                                        earlier in Limgrave), you can find him stuck in ground near the
                                        Starscourge crater after the battle. Smack him out again for some
                                        Exalted Flesh and his thanks. He'll move on to Liurnia then Mt. Gelmir
                                        (we'll see him later).
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Meteorite Staff & Rock Sling (for casters):</strong> In central Caelid
                                        swamp (Street of Sages Ruins), there's a chest with <strong>Rock Sling</strong> (a
                                        powerful gravity spell) and on a corpse nearby, the <strong>Meteorite Staff</strong>
                                        (S-tier early sorcery staff). This is only if you want a hybrid Int
                                        option or to use these for fun; our build doesn't need it, but it's a
                                        notable early-game nuke combo that some speedruns use.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Golden Scarab Talisman:</strong> If you want to boost rune acquisition, the
                                        <strong>Abandoned Cave</strong> in Caelid (near Smoldering Wall, across a canyon)
                                        contains this talisman (increases runes gained by 20%). The cave is
                                        poisonous and has two Cleanrot Knight bosses -- a bit annoying, so only
                                        do this if you feel like farming runes faster. Otherwise skip.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h4>Nokron, Eternal City (opened after Radahn)</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Fast-travel to Fort Haight West grace (Mistwood). Go west and you'll see a huge crater in
                                    the ground with floating rocks -- that's the star impact site. Carefully
                                    platform down the rocks and cliffs to enter Nokron. Follow the path,
                                    defeat the spectral enemies, and you'll reach a fog gate for the <strong>Mimic
                                    Tear boss</strong>. This boss copies your character's gear and moves. <strong>Pro
                                    tip:</strong>
                                </p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Cheese the Mimic:</strong> Before entering, <em>unequip</em> your weapon (and
                                        potentially armor). Step through; the Mimic will spawn copying your
                                        current state -- if you're basically unarmed, it's far weaker. Then
                                        simply reequip your gear and beat it down. The Mimic Tear will go down
                                        easily. This yields a Larval Tear and Silver Tear Mask (if you want an
                                        Arcane-boosting headpiece).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Proceed forward to the Nokron city proper. Grab the <strong>Nokron map
                                    fragment</strong> at the start. Our main target is the <strong>Night's Sacred
                                    Ground</strong>:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        From the first Nokron Site of Grace, head east along rooftops. You'll
                                        eventually drop into a wooded area with ruins. You'll see a majestic
                                        building ahead -- that's the entrance to Night's Sacred Ground. Navigate
                                        the rooftops and ledges (watch for blobs and silver tears ambushing).
                                        Eventually, cross a narrow arch where a giant ball enemy rolls at you
                                        (run or dodge aside). Past that, enter a church-like building.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Acquire the Mimic Tear Ash:</strong> In this building, there's a fog-sealed
                                        door you can unlock with a Stonesword Key. Inside is a chest containing
                                        the <strong>Mimic Tear Ashes</strong>. This summon literally creates a copy of <em>you</em>
                                        (with your current weapons/armor) at the cost of HP instead of FP. The
                                        Mimic Tear at +10 is arguably the strongest summon in the game,
                                        effectively doubling your damage output and taking aggro. This ash will
                                        become a cornerstone of our strategy for tough late-game bosses. We'll
                                        want to upgrade it as soon as we can (ghost gloveworts can be found in
                                        Nokron and later Nokstella).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Also, in Night's Sacred Ground, make sure to loot the treasure in the
                                        final hall: the <strong>Finger Slayer Blade</strong> (key item for Ranni) and the
                                        <strong>Great Ghost Glovewort</strong> (which instantly upgrades a summon to +10 if
                                        you have the upgrade level unlocked). Give the Blade to Ranni back at
                                        Ranni's Rise when you return -- she'll reward you with the <strong>Carian
                                        Inverted Statue</strong>, which is used to unlock a secret area in Carian Study
                                        Hall (for the cursemark needed in Fia's quest) and ultimately leads to
                                        <strong>Ainsel River Main</strong> (Ranni will eventually send you there).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>
                                    At this point, you can either continue deeper into Ranni's quest (which
                                    involves exploring <strong>Ainsel River</strong>, <strong>Nokstella</strong> and fighting another
                                    major boss Astel, then reaching the Moonlight Altar, etc.), or hold off.
                                    Pursuing it now is optional -- it yields legendary items and the Age of
                                    Stars ending, but we can also do it later. The most important things we
                                    got from Nokron for our playthrough efficiency are the <strong>Mimic Tear
                                    Ash</strong> (ensure you upgrade it; you can find Ghost Glovewort [3]-[6]
                                    in Nokron's Ancestral Woods area if needed, and [7]-[9] in later
                                    underground zones).
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Now, having conquered Caelid's major boss and plundered Nokron, you
                                    should be significantly stronger:
                                </p>

                                        Level ~70 (the Radahn remembrance is worth 40k runes if consumed,
                                        plus all Nokron loot and enemy runes).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Weapons: Bloodhound's Fang +6 or higher (you can get Somber 5,6 from
                                        Nokron and buy Somber 3-4 from Iji or Roundtable after giving
                                        appropriate bell bearings).
                                    </li>

                                        New Weapon Option: <strong>Winged Scythe</strong> (if you detoured to Tombsward
                                        Ruins in Weeping) or <strong>Moonveil Katana</strong> (if you defeated Magma Wyrm in
                                        Gael Tunnel, Caelid) -- optional weapons if you want variety (Moonveil
                                        requires Int 23, not in our build currently unless you respec).

                                    <li>
                                        Summon: Mimic Tear (upgrade this as much as possible, at least to
                                        +5-+6 with what you found).

                                        Great Runes: You have Godrick's, Rennala's (passive), and Radahn's.
                                        You can activate Radahn's at <strong>Divine Tower of Caelid</strong> (north in
                                        Dragonbarrow, same route as Bestial Sanctum -- use the tower elevator to
                                        restore it). Consider equipping Radahn's Great Rune -- the max HP boost
                                        is huge for survivability going forward.

                                    Everything optional we set out to do is now done. From here on, we'll
                                    rejoin the critical path at <strong>Altus Plateau and Leyndell</strong>. Use the
                                    Dectus Medallion at the Grand Lift of Dectus (if you haven't already) or
                                    if you did Rya's quest, you might have a Volcano Manor invite (we'll
                                    cover that in Altus section). Let's proceed to Part 4, ascending to
                                    Altus Plateau and infiltrating Leyndell, Royal Capital.

                                    -- the upland region leading to the capital. We'll use the Grand Lift of
                                    Dectus to get there quickly (since we collected both medallion halves).
                                    In this part, we'll traverse Altus, optionally stop by <strong>Mt. Gelmir</strong>
                                    (Volcano Manor) for another shardbearer (Rykard), and then enter
                                    <strong>Leyndell, Royal Capital</strong> to defeat <strong>Morgott, the Omen King</strong> -- the
                                    final hurdle before the path to the Erdtree opens. We'll also pick up
                                    the second half of the Haligtree Secret Medallion and other key items in
                                    the region to prepare for late-game optional areas.

                                        Plateau Map Fragment</strong> just west along the road. The environment is
                                        golden with autumnal trees -- welcome to Altus.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h4>Altus Plateau Overview</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Altus has two main story destinations: east
                                    leads to the Capital outskirts (Lyndell), and west leads to Mt. Gelmir
                                    (Volcano Manor). First, let's set up a few things:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Just north of the lift, find the <strong>Altus Tunnel</strong> if you want some
                                        upgrade stones (optional).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Golden Seed</strong>: On the main road toward the Capital, there's a Golden
                                        Seed by a small encampment.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>NPCs:</strong> At Altus Plateau grace, you might find <strong>Latenna</strong> (if you
                                        did the Lakeside Crystal Cave quest in Liurnia) but not crucial for us.
                                        Also, <strong>Brother Corhyn</strong> and <strong>Goldmask's</strong> quest will have Corhyn moved
                                        from Roundtable to Altus Highway Junction grace, and Goldmask is on the
                                        collapsed bridge north of there -- but this quest is only for an
                                        alternate ending and the <strong>Golden Order Rune</strong>, which isn't needed for
                                        our goals (skip unless you aim for the Age of Order ending).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h4>Optional: Mt. Gelmir & Volcano Manor (Shardbearer Rykard)</h4>
                                <p>
                                    If you want to take down another optional shardbearer and get the powerful
                                    <strong>Blasphemous Blade (greatsword)</strong> for a Faith build, you can head west
                                    at the Altus Junction to Mt. Gelmir. You can also wait until after
                                    capital; however, doing it now is viable. Summarizing:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        From Altus Highway Junction grace, go west through the forest, past
                                        the Bridge of Iniquity to the Mt. Gelmir region. Follow the path with
                                        ladders and camps up the mountain. Eventually, you reach <strong>Volcano
                                        Manor</strong> at the summit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        At <strong>Volcano Manor</strong>, talk to Lady Tanith and consider joining. If you
                                        join, you get the Drawing-Room Key and can do assassination quests
                                        instead of exploring the volcano dungeon. For speed, you might skip
                                        straight to Rykard: <em>Fast method</em>: In the Drawing-Room, there's an
                                        illusory wall leading to the prison town. Navigate through the
                                        lava-filled prison town, past an Iron Maiden, up an elevator, and you'll
                                        find the boss portal to <strong>Godskin Noble</strong>. Defeat the Noble (bleed
                                        wrecks him; he's portly but has dangerous black flame attacks -- roll
                                        through them and counter). After Noble, proceed to Rykard's lair.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Boss: Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy (Shardbearer, optional):</strong> In the
                                        audience chamber, pick up the <strong>Serpent-Hunter</strong> spear from the ground.
                                        This special weapon is meant for this fight -- it fires wind blades and
                                        does massive damage to Rykard. Two-hand it (stats don't matter, it's
                                        super-buffed in this arena). Lock on to the giant God-Devouring Serpent
                                        (phase 1) and spam heavy attacks with the spear from mid-range to
                                        stagger it. Phase 2, Rykard himself emerges with a flaming skull-snake
                                        form. Continue using Serpent-Hunter's unique attacks; dodge or block the
                                        skull vomit and sword swings. With this weapon, Rykard will go down
                                        fast. He drops <strong>Rykard's Great Rune</strong> (when equipped, it heals you for
                                        each enemy kill -- interesting but situational) and a Remembrance for
                                        the Blasphemous Blade (a greatsword that lifesteals on kill and has a
                                        strong flame wave skill).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        After Rykard, if Alexander the jar was met at Radahn, he'll be here in
                                        Volcano Manor's audience room (if you missed him, he might not appear).
                                        Talk to him. Also, Tanith will leave eventually and can be found
                                        consuming Rykard's remains (you can kill her for her gear if desired).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Note:</strong> Volcano Manor content is optional. If you skip Rykard, it
                                        doesn't affect your ability to complete the game since he's not required.
                                        We include it for thoroughness and runes/gear.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h4>Capital Outskirts (Altus Plateau East)</h4>
                                <p>
                                    From the Altus Junction,
                                    head east up the hill along the road. You'll reach the <strong>Outer Wall
                                    Phantom Tree</strong> Site of Grace (there's a Minor Erdtree nearby with an
                                    Erdtree Avatar boss -- killing it yields two good Crystal Tears, one of
                                    which is the <strong>Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear</strong> that boosts holy damage,
                                    not critical for us). Follow the path around the outer wall:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Golden Seeds:</strong> Two seeds can be found along the outer wall path
                                        (one at Phantom Tree grace, one further along at another grace called
                                        Outer Wall Battleground).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>NPC Summon Sign:</strong> Near the Outer Wall Battleground grace, you can
                                        find a gold summon sign for <strong>Recusant Henricus</strong> (if you did Bernahl's
                                        quest) -- not important unless doing that NPC storyline.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Head left (north) to grab the Capital map fragment.</strong> There's a map
                                        stele by the road just before the big gate to Leyndell.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h4>Capital Entrance -- Draconic Tree Sentinel</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The main gate of
                                    Leyndell (at the end of the bridge) is guarded by a tough field boss:
                                    the <strong>Draconic Tree Sentinel</strong>. You must defeat him to enter the
                                    capital (the gate seal only opens after he falls). Prepare for a
                                    challenging fight:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The Draconic Tree Sentinel is like the earlier Tree Sentinel but with
                                        red lightning moves. Ensure you have a +7 or higher weapon by now.
                                        Summon your <strong>Mimic Tear</strong> or another strong spirit -- they can distract
                                        him. This boss hits very hard; have ~35+ Vigor so you don't get
                                        one-shot.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Strategy:</strong> Stay on foot (Torrent can be used, but you can't summon
                                        spirit on horseback, and on foot you can roll better). Bait his
                                        three-hit combos and either roll through or block with a 100% phys
                                        shield (though lightning will chip you). After his combo, punish with a
                                        jumping heavy or a Bloodhound's Fang skill. If using Mimic Tear, your
                                        clone will also do massive damage with your gear -- together you can
                                        stagger-lock him at times. Watch out for his <strong>lightning slam</strong> (he
                                        raises his shield which glows, then slams -- roll away from the impact)
                                        and his <strong>fire-breathing shield</strong> in phase 2. When he breathes fire, get
                                        to his side and hit him. When he charges lightning on his mace and does
                                        an AOE smash, get clear. You can also parry his regular swings (if
                                        you're confident), but not necessary.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Bleed and jump attacks will whittle him down. If you struggle,
                                        consider summoning a human cooperator (he's a common wall for players).
                                        Eventually, persistence pays off and he falls. <strong>Victory</strong> opens up
                                        <strong>Leyndell, Royal Capital</strong> for exploration!

                                        patrolling Tree Sentinel enemies -- be cautious or sneak behind them.

                                        him. Your Mimic Tear trivializes this fight -- two of you wailing on him
                                        will stagger him quickly. Defeat him to clear the way.

                                <h4>Boss: Morgott, the Omen King (Shardbearer #3)</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Morgott is
                                    essentially Margit's true form -- faster and with new holy attacks, but
                                    you have grown much stronger too. Prepare by equipping <strong>Margit's
                                    Shackle</strong> again -- it works on Morgott in phase 1 up to 2 times. Use
                                    Godrick's or Radahn's Great Rune activated for extra stats/HP.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Summon your <strong>Mimic Tear + whatever</strong> (or Melina/other player) for
                                        distraction. At fight start, immediately use <strong>Margit's Shackle</strong> twice
                                        to stun Morgott, giving you and your summon time to land heavy hits.
                                        Morgott moves fast and has a long combo with his cursed sword -- but
                                        with two of you, he'll be interrupted often. He still throws daggers --
                                        dodge or block those.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        At ~60% health, Morgott powers up, gaining holy blade and hammer
                                        moves. Back off when he plunges his sword to create explosive holy
                                        puddles on the arena floor. They'll erupt after a short delay -- avoid
                                        those areas. Continue applying pressure; bleed again works well on him.
                                        Between you and your Mimic, he should stagger (you can get a critical
                                        hit). Watch your health and don't stand in the holy pools. He has an
                                        overhead slam that sends a shockwave -- roll through it.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Overall, you'll find <strong>Morgott is easier than he looks</strong>, especially
                                        with your Mimic or Melina tanking him. Keep the assault up and he'll
                                        fall. This grants you <strong>Morgott's Great Rune</strong> (when activated later at
                                        East Altus Divine Tower, it raises max HP a ton like Radahn's does --
                                        similar effect) and the <strong>Remembrance of the Omen King</strong>.

                                    After victory, light the <strong>Erdtree Sanctuary grace</strong> if you haven't.
                                    Melina appears to congratulate you and gives you the <strong>Rold Medallion</strong>,
                                    which is needed to access the Grand Lift of Rold to the <strong>Mountaintops
                                    of the Giants</strong> (the next main region). You attempt to approach the
                                    Erdtree entrance but the thorns block you -- only the <strong>flame of ruin</strong>
                                    can burn them, hence your next mission is to journey to the mountaintops
                                    and sacrifice the <strong>Fire Giant</strong>.
                                </p>

                                        Before leaving the capital, consider exploring the <strong>Subterranean
                                        Shunning-Grounds</strong> beneath (a well in Avenue Balcony leads down). This
                                        sewer area is optional but contains the <strong>Dung Eater</strong> quest, a secret
                                        Frenzied Flame ending route, and the <strong>Lord of Blood's Exultation</strong>
                                        talisman (boosts damage when bleed occurs -- very good for our bleed
                                        build). If interested: fight the <strong>Mohg, the Omen</strong> boss at the end of
                                        the sewers to get that talisman. (This Mohg is a weaker omen version of
                                        the later Mohg, but still tough -- you can also wait and come back later
                                        when overleveled).

                                        Also, now that Morgott is defeated, you can open the chest in the
                                        <strong>Erdtree Sanctuary</strong> to get the <strong>Blessing of Erdtree</strong> spell.

                                        Make sure to pick up the <strong>Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right half)</strong>
                                        from <strong>Castle Sol</strong> in Mountaintops (coming up in Part 5). We'll do that
                                        to unlock the secret area later.

                                    With Morgott's defeat, the main path points north. Use the grace to
                                    <strong>teleport to the Forbidden Lands</strong> (or exit the capital via the East
                                    Capital Rampart where Melina teleports you). Next, we ascend the
                                    <strong>Mountaintops of the Giants</strong>, confront the Fire Giant, and trigger the
                                    path to the game's endgame areas.

                                    Having secured the medallion from Melina, we now venture into the
                                    <strong>Mountaintops of the Giants</strong>, the snowy region beyond the Forbidden
                                    Lands. Here we must retrieve the <strong>fire of ruin</strong> by defeating the
                                    <strong>Fire Giant</strong>, then use it to burn the Erdtree's thorns. This will
                                    transition us to <strong>Crumbling Farum Azula</strong>, a late-game area where we'll
                                    face the penultimate boss, <strong>Maliketh</strong>. This part focuses on
                                    efficiency: we'll grab the Haligtree medallion half in Castle Sol (for
                                    later optional content), then go straight to Fire Giant. Optionally,
                                    we'll mention the <strong>Forge of the Giants</strong> choice and things to do before
                                    initiating the burn (like completing Millicent's quest if desired).
                                    Finally, we cover Farum Azula and Maliketh.

                                        <strong>Forbidden Lands</strong> (dark foggy area). It's a fairly linear path. Use a
                                        torch as needed. There's not much to collect here aside from a few
                                        Golden Runes and a Black Blade Kindred boss at the lift (which you can
                                        ignore by just running past into the lift portal).

                                        Reach the <strong>Grand Lift of Rold</strong>. Use the <strong>Rold Medallion</strong> given by
                                        Melina to operate it. (Note: If you have both halves of the Haligtree
                                        Secret Medallion, you could also "Hoist secret medallion" here, but we
                                        only have one half so far, so just use Rold's.)

                                        This takes you up to the <strong>Mountaintops of the Giants -- West</strong> side.

                                    Bitter cold and new tough
                                    foes (imps, runebears, hands, and minotaur-like warriors). Our aims:

                                <ol>

                                        <strong>Map Fragment:</strong> Straight ahead from the lift, follow the path and
                                        grab the <strong>Mountaintops West map</strong> at the stele.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Castle Sol (Haligtree Medallion Right):</strong> If you plan to do the
                                        Haligtree later (Malenia's area), detour north now. From the lift, ride
                                        northeast through the snowfield past Stargazer's Ruins to <strong>Castle
                                        Sol</strong>. Fight through the castle (lots of spectral Banished Knights). At
                                        the top, defeat <strong>Commander Niall</strong> (a challenging fight similar to
                                        Commander O'Neil but with two Banished Knight summons). Use bleed and
                                        summons (Mimic is great) to take him down -- focus the two knights first
                                        or use freezing pots to slow them. After Niall, climb the tower behind
                                        him and loot the chest for the <strong>Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right)</strong>.
                                        Now you have both halves! We'll use them after Farum Azula to access the
                                        Haligtree optional area. (There's also a legendary armament <strong>Sword of
                                        Night and Flame</strong> in a chest in Sol, if interested.)
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Fire Giant (Main Story):</strong> From the lift or Castle Sol, make your
                                        way to the southeast side of the western mountaintop. Cross the long
                                        frozen lake (watch out for the giant <strong>Death Rite Bird</strong> at night -- you
                                        can sprint past or avoid at day). Continue south to the <strong>Whiteridge
                                        Road</strong> grace. Ascend the chain-linked bridge to the <strong>Giants'
                                        Gravepost</strong> grace, which is just before the Fire Giant's area. Grab the
                                        <strong>Mountaintops East map</strong> fragment on the way (on a stele near Giants'
                                        Gravepost grace).

                                    Ensure you prepare for the Fire Giant: he deals physical and fire
                                    damage. Equipping a <strong>Fireproof Dried Liver</strong> or the <strong>Flame-Drake
                                    Talisman +1/2</strong> (if you have) can help mitigate damage. Allocate your
                                    flasks (maybe more HP flasks than FP -- Mimic uses HP anyway). Summon
                                    signs for NPCs aren't present here, so rely on spirit ash.

                                <h4>Boss: Fire Giant (Shardbearer #4)</h4>
                                <p>
                                    This massive boss has two phases
                                    focusing on his legs. Key points: stay mounted on Torrent for mobility
                                    (you can do this entire fight on horseback, which is recommended for
                                    speed), and target his weak left ankle (the one with the cracked red
                                    scar).
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Phase 1:</strong> The Fire Giant rolls around and stomps. <strong>Torrent
                                        strategy:</strong> Gallop towards his left side (our right when facing him) and
                                        strike his wounded leg (the one without the big plate). When he
                                        prepares to <strong>snowbowling</strong> (launch a giant snowball that explodes),
                                        ride perpendicular to avoid it. If he does a flame platter attack
                                        (spreads fire on ground), dash out of the area. Try to stay near or
                                        under him -- many of his attacks will miss if you're at his feet.
                                        Dual-wield or two-hand your weapon for max damage; jump attacks on the
                                        ankle are very effective. After enough damage, he'll flinch and
                                        transition.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Phase 2 (50% HP):</strong> He rips off his leg (ouch) and fights from range
                                        more. A fire eye opens in his chest. He'll start using <strong>immense fire
                                        AoEs</strong> -- when he slams the ground sending fire shockwaves, jump with
                                        Torrent or iframe through them. When he summons a giant fire orb
                                        (sun-like), run far as it will spew flames continuously around him.
                                        Continue to attack his remaining leg or hands when you can. If you
                                        dismount, you can roll under some attacks and hit his hands too, but
                                        staying mounted helps you reposition quickly especially when he jumps
                                        away.

                                        Use <strong>Mimic Tear</strong> at the start of phase 2 (or phase 1 if you prefer)
                                        -- it'll distract him and double your DPS. With bleed procs, you'll
                                        chunk him down. He has a lot of HP, but stick and move. Each bleed
                                        removes a big % of his health. Watch out for his meteoric flame
                                        projectiles (keep moving to avoid).

                                        Eventually, the giant will fall, granting a huge rune reward, <strong>Fire
                                        Giant's Remembrance</strong>, and unlocking the path to the <strong>Forge of the

                                    Rest at the <strong>Foot of the Forge grace</strong> after Fire Giant. <strong>Important:
                                    Point of No Return coming up.</strong> When you approach the <strong>Forge of the
                                    Giants</strong> (the enormous cauldron), you will need to trigger the burning
                                    of the Erdtree:
                                </p>

                                        Talk to Melina at the Forge site. She will perform the sacrifice (if
                                        you have not inherited the Frenzied Flame; assuming you followed this
                                        guide, you did not meet the Three Fingers, so Melina burns). Choosing to
                                        commit the burn triggers a cutscene and transports you to <strong>Crumbling
                                        Farum Azula</strong> automatically.

                                        <strong>Warning:</strong> Once you burn the tree, Leyndell becomes the Ashen
                                        Capital and some content in the capital (like the sewers quest, certain
                                        item locations) changes or becomes inaccessible. <strong>Make sure you have
                                        done anything you wanted in Leyndell</strong> (e.g., got Bolt of Gransax,
                                        finished Dung Eater quest, etc.) before doing this. Also, if you
                                        embraced the Frenzied Flame (again, unlikely here), Melina would leave
                                        and you'd have to use a different method to burn the tree (the game
                                        handles this).

                                        When ready, proceed. If you want to explore optional <strong>Consecrated
                                        Snowfield/Mohgwyn/Haligtree</strong> <em>before</em> endgame, you <strong>don't have to do
                                        it now</strong> -- you can still do them after burning, except Goldmask/Corhyn
                                        quest ends. We will cover those in Part 6 as optional content you can
                                        undertake <strong>before finishing the game</strong>.

                                    Go ahead and allow Melina to ignite the flame. The Erdtree starts to
                                    burn and you (the player) are whisked off in a storm to <strong>Crumbling
                                    Farum Azula</strong>, a floating ruin outside time.

                                    aims here: reach and defeat <strong>Maliketh, the Black Blade</strong>, the keeper of
                                    Destined Death. Additionally, we can get more Somber stones to max out

                                        <strong>Bernahl Invasion (Devourer's Scepter):</strong> If you completed Volcano
                                        Manor quests or not, at the Beside the Great Bridge grace area,
                                        <strong>Recusant Bernahl</strong> will invade (near the great bridge before
                                        Maliketh's arena). Defeat him to get the <strong>Devourer's Scepter</strong> weapon
                                        and <strong>Bernahl's armor set</strong>. He's aggressive but by this stage you
                                        should out-damage him, especially with a summon or by parrying.

                                        <strong>Alexander's Final Meeting:</strong> Just before Maliketh, on the Great
                                        Bridge, you will find <strong>Iron Fist Alexander</strong> one last time (if you did
                                        Radahn and found him in Liurnia/Gelmir). He challenges you to a duel.
                                        Accept and fight him -- it's a friendly duel but you need to actually
                                        defeat him. Be careful; Alexander hits surprisingly hard with his lava
                                        attacks. Stay mid-range to avoid his explosion and strike when he cools
                                        down. After beating him, Alexander will sadly crack and die, giving you
                                        <strong>Alexander's Innards</strong> (key item for Jar-Bairn quest) and the <strong>Shard
                                        of Alexander</strong> talisman, which <strong>boosts your skill attack power by 15%</strong>
                                        -- an excellent talisman especially since we use Bloodhound's Fang skill
                                        often. Equip that for sure.

                                        <strong>Godskin Duo (Mini-Boss):</strong> Midway through Farum Azula, you'll enter
                                        a church and get ambushed by the <strong>Godskin Duo</strong> (Godskin Apostle +
                                        Godskin Noble at once) in a large arena. This fight can be rough due to
                                        two strong bosses tag-teaming. Use the <strong>Sleep Pots</strong> or <strong>Sleep
                                        Arrows</strong> trick if you have -- 2-3 sleep pots can put one of them to
                                        sleep allowing you to focus the other. Alternatively, summon your Mimic
                                        Tear for distraction. Focus on taking one down at a time (often the
                                        Noble first since he's slower but soakier, or Apostle first since he's
                                        aggressive -- decide based on who your summon distracts). When one dies,
                                        it'll revive after a short while if the other isn't dead yet, but each
                                        has a shared total HP bar you must deplete. Use pillars to break line of
                                        sight and isolate them. Bleed helps, and your weapon skill can hit both
                                        if lined up. Defeating them yields the <strong>Smithing Stone Miner's Bell
                                        Bearing [4]</strong> (buy infinite smithing 7-9 at Twin Husks now) and
                                        unlocks a grace in that room.

                                        just run past the dragons -- fighting is optional).

                                        got it. <strong>Somber Ancient Dragonstone:</strong> There's one on a floating
                                        platform puzzle after beating Maliketh (so don't leave Azula immediately
                                        after Maliketh if you want it; you can grab one in a chest behind an
                                        illusory wall in the area above where you fought the Godskin Duo, which
                                        you can access by dropping down near the great bridge).

                                        Eventually you reach the <strong>Beside the Great Bridge grace</strong> (just

                                <p>
                                    This is a two-phase fight: <strong>Phase
                                    1</strong> against the Beast Clergyman, and <strong>Phase 2</strong> against Maliketh
                                    proper. Maliketh's attacks can inflict a debuff that <strong>reduces your max
                                    HP for a time</strong> and prevents healing from restoring the lost portion --
                                    very dangerous, so avoid getting hit consecutively.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Phase 1 -- Beast Clergyman:</strong> He's very aggressive, throwing rocks
                                        (Beast Claw, etc.) and slashing with his dagger. He's basically Gurranq
                                        on steroids. Use <strong>pillars</strong> in the arena to block his rock flings. When
                                        he jumps at you with Beast Claw, roll under/through it and attack. Try
                                        to get as much damage in this phase as possible (some say <em>don't</em> summon
                                        yet, to save your Mimic's health for phase 2 when the real challenge
                                        begins). However, you can also summon Mimic at the start to double-team
                                        him and try to push phase 2 quickly -- just be mindful Maliketh's
                                        attacks will chew up a Mimic's HP if it doesn't dodge well.

                                        Around 50% health, cutscene to <strong>Maliketh, the Black Blade</strong>. He now
                                        is acrobatic, with a huge range and very damaging strikes that cause the
                                        red max HP burn debuff. Now is the time to definitely use your <strong>Mimic
                                        Tear</strong> if not already -- it can distract Maliketh (though he jumps
                                        around a lot).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Maliketh's weakness is <strong>frost and stance-breaking</strong>. If you have a
                                        weapon or pots that do Frostbite, it can help (frost staggers and
                                        increases damage taken). But pure melee works -- jump attacks to break
                                        his poise. Whenever he does a big slam and sword sticks in ground, get
                                        hits in, but watch out: he often follows up a combo with a sudden sword
                                        beam (he'll leap and slice sending a wave) -- roll through it. Staying
                                        mid-close is ideal so he uses melee more than ranged blade beams. If you
                                        see him jump up spinning and raining blades, sprint or dodge
                                        continuously until it's over.

                                        We want to burst him down before he can kill us with chip damage.
                                        <strong>Flask of Wondrous Physick</strong>: if you have the <strong>Opaline Bubbletear</strong>,
                                        use it pre-fight so you can survive one big hit. Also, the
                                        <strong>Crimsonwhorl Bubbletear</strong> can convert one hit's damage to heal (but
                                        these are optional).
                                    </li>

                                        With two of you attacking, Maliketh will hopefully split attention or
                                        get stance broken for a critical. <strong>Use Shard of Alexander talisman</strong> to
                                        amplify your Bloodhound's Finesse or other skill -- a few heavy combos
                                        can bring him down. Don't give him room to breathe -- the more you
                                        pressure, the less fancy moves he does.

                                    <li>
                                        After a tense battle, Maliketh falls. This grants the <strong>Remembrance of
                                        the Black Blade</strong> and you'll see a dramatic in-game event: Destined
                                        Death is unleashed, Farum Azula crumbles, and you awaken back in
                                        Leyndell -- now completely ashen and ruined.

                                    Congratulations -- you have essentially completed the main required
                                    bosses! After Maliketh, all that's left is to face the final bosses back
                                    in Ashen Capital and decide on an ending. We'll handle that in Part 7.
                                    But before we conclude, <strong>Part 6</strong> will address the remaining <em>optional
                                    areas</em> -- namely the <strong>Haligtree and Malenia</strong>, and <strong>Mohgwyn Palace</strong>.
                                    These are entirely optional for completion, but we'll cover them for
                                    thoroughness. If you wish, you can tackle them now before the final
                                    boss, as the game lets you explore even after burning the Erdtree (just
                                    teleport out of Leyndell after Maliketh, as long as you don't enter the
                                    final boss area yet).

                                    <em>At this point, your character is likely ~Level 100-120. You should have your

                                    the Somber Ancient Dragonstone from Farum Azula or from completing
                                    Latenna's quest. Your bleed build is extremely potent; coupling it with

                                    to the hidden <strong>Consecrated Snowfield</strong>.

                                        <strong>Ordina, Liturgical Town (Haligtree portal puzzle):</strong> On the west
                                        side of the Snowfield is Ordina. Activate the evergaol by the town
                                        statue. Inside the evergaol, you must <strong>light 4 flame beacons</strong> located
                                        around town <em>while avoiding deadly enemies (invisible assassins and
                                        archers)</em>. This is a stealthy platforming puzzle. Tips: Immediately
                                        crouch and sneak behind buildings to avoid the sniper on the roof. Light
                                        the first flame on ground level by the entrance. Then head up ladder in
                                        far west to second flame (beware an assassin up there). Third flame is
                                        across rooftops guarded by a second sniper -- you can run in zigzag to
                                        avoid his arrows and climb that tower. The fourth is lower in town
                                        behind a patrolling assassin. Using a <strong>Sentry's Torch</strong> can reveal
                                        invisible assassins if you have one. Once all four are lit, the evergaol
                                        dispels. A waygate in Ordina is now active -- use it to teleport to

                                    secret area, extremely challenging. It's essentially a gigantic downward
                                    spiral tree area filled with pests and guardians.

                                        Work your way down branches and structures carefully -- one slip can
                                        mean a fall to death. The first grace is <strong>Haligtree Canopy</strong>. From
                                        there, drop to branches, fight Haligtree Soldiers, avoid or kill giant

                                        Next grace: <strong>Haligtree Town</strong>. The town is swarming with <strong>Kindred of
                                        Rot</strong> (giant pests that cause Scarlet Rot) and pest enemies. Equip
                                        <strong>Immunizing Horn Charm</strong> or craft <strong>Preserving Boluses</strong> to handle rot
                                        buildup. You can largely run past sections if needed, hitting only
                                        critical enemies.

                                        Navigate across rooftops and roots to reach <strong>Haligtree Roots</strong> at the
                                        bottom of Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree (the city at base of tree).
                                        You'll fight <strong>Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree</strong> mid-way (similar to
                                        Carian Manor Loretta but now spectral and stronger). Use the same
                                        tactics as before: dodge her glintstone sorcery and jump attacks, then
                                        punish. With your level, she should be manageable. Defeating her gives
                                        <strong>Loretta's Mastery</strong> sorcery and her War Sickle weapon.

                                        <strong>Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree:</strong> A grace is right after Loretta.
                                        This is a difficult gauntlet: crystalized rot swamp sections (walk slow,
                                        cause rot), ulcerated tree spirits, many tough knights. If your goal is
                                        Malenia, you can <em>sprint</em> through a lot here:

                                        From Elphael grace, go down and around, you'll find a room with
                                        <strong>Prayer Room grace</strong> -- use it as checkpoint.

                                        From Prayer Room, run out, drop down through a hole on the left to
                                        bypass some enemies, head toward the far end of the zone where a large
                                        stone structure leads to the roots. It's easy to get lost -- use prism
                                        stones or memorize the route from guides.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Make sure to grab any <strong>Somber Ancient Dragonstones</strong> (one is in a
                                        chest guarded by knights in a side chapel behind an imp statue door).

                                        Eventually, you reach a bridge with a Cleanrot Knight duo and beyond
                                        it, the <strong>Haligtree Roots Site of Grace</strong> -- the final grace before
                                        Malenia.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        At this point, prepare thoroughly: <strong>Malenia, Blade of Miquella</strong> is
                                        arguably the hardest boss in FromSoftware history. She is optional but
                                        we assume you want to try. Ensure your <strong>Mimic Tear is +10</strong> and
                                        consider adjusting build slightly: Malenia is very susceptible to
                                        <strong>bleed and frost</strong> but <strong>resistant to fire</strong>. If you have a spare
                                        weapon to apply Frostbite (like a Cold-infused Uchigatana or the Dark
                                        Moon Greatsword from Ranni's quest), it can help apply extra damage. But
                                        pure bleed works fine.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Equip Lord of Blood's Exultation</strong> (boost damage on bleed) and
                                        <strong>Alexander's Shard</strong> (boost skill damage). Also, <strong>Waterfowl Dance
                                        countermeasures</strong>: her infamous attack can one-shot. One strat is to use a
                                        <strong>shield with high physical</strong> and stack <strong>endurance + Barricade Shield</strong>
                                        ash to block it, or simply run far and time a dodge at final flurry.
                                        Another is use the <strong>White Reed armor set</strong> (highest poise) to tank a hit
                                        and roll. There's also a <strong>frost pot + bloodhound step</strong> cheese. We'll
                                        assume using Mimic plus aggressive DPS to interrupt her.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h4>Boss: Malenia, Blade of Miquella / Goddess of Rot</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Phase 1 (Blade of Miquella):</strong> Malenia is quick and every hit she
                                        lands <strong>heals her</strong>. So the key is <strong>don't get hit</strong>. Summon your Mimic
                                        immediately to draw some aggro. Two of you attacking can stagger-lock
                                        Malenia fairly often, as her poise is low. Use jumping attacks and
                                        weapon skills to force her into defense. She often will dodge and try to
                                        counter with thrusts -- dodge to her side and punish. Watch for
                                        <strong>Waterfowl Dance</strong>: When she leaps up and hangs then dives, either
                                        <strong>sprint directly away</strong> (if you're far enough, the whole combo can
                                        miss) or try to time dodges for each sequence (hard). If you are caught,
                                        spam roll and chug a flask after; or hope your Mimic hits her to stagger
                                        out of it (rare but possible). Bleed procs take big chunks of her
                                        health, so keep pressure. If your Mimic dies in phase1, it's okay -- you
                                        can possibly solo phase2 or consider retrying with a different plan
                                        (maybe using a spirit like <strong>Black Knife Tiche</strong> which dodges well).

                                        <strong>Phase 2 (Goddess of Rot):</strong> Malenia gains Scarlet Rot attacks and a
                                        new <strong>Scarlet Aeonia</strong> dive bomb where she explodes into a giant rot
                                        flower. When she ascends slowly and shouts, immediately <strong>run far</strong> to
                                        avoid the bloom, or try to time an iframe jump. The bloom causes rot
                                        buildup -- stay out of it. After the bloom, she'll hover slowly -- this
                                        is a good moment to hit her with a ranged attack or approach carefully
                                        as she emerges. She retains all phase1 moves (including Waterfowl). New
                                        moves: she can send out clones that strike (dodge through them) and a
                                        grab that does massive damage/rot (avoid at all cost). Try to keep your
                                        Mimic alive into phase2 by maybe not summoning it until phase2 begins
                                        (some solo Malenia to 80% then summon so it's fresh). In phase2, a
                                        useful tactic is <strong>Rotten Breath or Swarm of Flies</strong> incantation --
                                        ironically, she can be inflicted with Scarlet Rot! But since we have
                                        bleed, stick to that. Stay aggressive but cautious; if she starts
                                        Waterfowl and you're mid-range, one trick is <strong>to spam roll into her</strong>
                                        -- surprisingly, being very close, rolling into the first flurry and
                                        hugging her can sometimes avoid most hits, then you roll again for
                                        second and third flurries. Alternatively, keep distance and let Mimic
                                        eat it (Mimic often dies to it though).

                                        It may take a few tries, but each attempt learn her patterns. With
                                        bleed procs, you might push her quickly. A well-timed <strong>Bloodhound's
                                        Finesse</strong> can knock her down out of some attacks. Eventually, you can
                                        triumph. The reward is <strong>Remembrance of Malenia</strong> (which can be traded
                                        for the Hand of Malenia katana or Scarlet Aeonia spell) and the
                                        satisfaction of having beaten her. Also, you can find <strong>Miquella's
                                        Needle</strong> via completing Millicent's quest here (not covered in full;
                                        it's used to undo Frenzy flame ending if needed).

                                    The other major optional area. If
                                    you did Varre's quest, you have the <strong>Pureblood Knight's Medal</strong>. Use it
                                    from your inventory to teleport to Mohgwyn Palace (otherwise, reach here
                                    via a portal in the west Consecrated Snowfield, but Varre's way is
                                    quicker).

                                        You'll arrive at <strong>Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint grace</strong>. The blood
                                        swamps cause rapid bleed buildup -- use Torrent to traverse and equip a

                                        Reach <strong>Palace Approach Ledge-Road grace</strong> -- a famous rune-farming
                                        spot (Albinaurics that give tons of runes with AoE spells). From here,
                                        proceed up the blood-soaked stairs, fight through some very tough red
                                        phantom Sanguine nobles (they hit hard; you can run past or take them
                                        one at a time).

                                        At the top, activate <strong>Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance grace</strong>. The door to
                                        Mohg is just ahead. This is a good time to use a <strong>Purifying Crystal
                                        Tear</strong> in your Physick if you have it (gotten from the invader Eleanora
                                        at Second Church of Marika). This tear specifically negates Mohg's
                                        cursed blood explosion phase. If you don't have it, you can still
                                        survive with healing timing.

                                        <strong>Boss: Mohg, Lord of Blood:</strong> Mohg is a shardbearer (Great Rune).
                                        Fight is similar difficulty to Morgott/Radahn level.

                                    <li>
                                        Mohg's attacks are mostly fire/blood arcane. He will periodically cast
                                        <strong>"Nihil" ritual</strong> -- announcing in Latin as <strong>I, II, III</strong> -- during
                                        which red rings form around you. These signify he's about to detonate a
                                        <strong>curse-blood ritual</strong> in phase 2 that will hit you 3 times for heavy
                                        damage. Normally, you can't avoid that damage. But <strong>if you mixed
                                        Purifying Crystal Tear</strong> in your Wondrous Physick and drink it during
                                        fight, it will significantly reduce that ritual damage. If not, you
                                        must heal through it (save your flask charges).

                                        Phase 1: Fairly straightforward -- avoid his trident combos, dodge
                                        blood flames on ground. Punish when he does a long animation (like
                                        summoning blood). Bleed works on him, but ironically he's quite
                                        resistant to it because he is master of blood. Still, your raw damage
                                        from BHF is fine.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        When you knock him to ~60%, he transitions. He will rise in air,
                                        become invulnerable, and initiate the <strong>3-hit curse ritual</strong> (you'll see
                                        the Roman numerals count down). <strong>Quick tip:</strong> Right when he says the
                                        second "Nihil", <strong>chug your Physick with Purifying Tear</strong> -- it will
                                        negate the curse damage. Otherwise, immediately spam heal after the 3rd
                                        explosion to not die.

                                        Phase 2: Now he has wings and more aggressive attacks including
                                        summoning burning blood. This is chaotic -- use your Mimic Tear for
                                        distraction. Stick close to him and behind if possible to avoid his
                                        forward cone blood flame attacks. Roll his trident swipes and jump
                                        attack him. Each time you bleed him it does decent chunk (even if
                                        resist, he has high HP). When he flies up to rain blood spears, keep
                                        moving.

                                        With Mimic and strong DPS, Mohg should fall. You earn <strong>Remembrance of

                                    It's time for the final confrontation. Return to <strong>Leyndell, Ashen
                                    Capital</strong> (which is what the Royal Capital becomes after burning).
                                    You'll spawn at the <strong>Leyndell, Capital of Ash</strong> Site of Grace (after
                                    Maliketh, you were automatically teleported here). The city is now
                                    mostly empty white ash dunes. The path to the Erdtree is open, but a
                                    couple challenges remain:

                                        As you move toward the ruined Erdtree, at the foot of the tree you'll
                                        encounter <strong>Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing</strong> (he has turned hostile,
                                        determined to stop you). Gideon's fight is more of a lore fight -- he's
                                        basically a human NPC with a variety of spells (he'll cast things like
                                        Comet Azur, Crucible incants, etc., based on what knowledge he has of
                                        your progress). He's not too hard: aggressive melee will stagger him.
                                        Just don't let him free-cast something like Azur beam at you -- run
                                        behind him or around a pillar. Take him down, and he yields his armor
                                        set and talisman.

                                        Loux</strong>. This is a two-phase fight (like Maliketh).

                                        powerful than the shade you beat earlier, with new moves. He does huge
                                        axe sweeps and foot stomps that cause shockwaves. Use your Mimic (or
                                        Tiche) to split aggro. Roll through his axe combos, and punish after his
                                        big overhead slam (which leaves his axe stuck for a moment). When he
                                        stomps creating a shockwave, either iframe jump or be off the ground
                                        (shockwave won't hit you mid-air).

                                        At ~50%, cinematic where he throws aside the lion Serosh and becomes
                                        <strong>Hoarah Loux, Warrior</strong> -- a shirtless wrestling champ.

                                        <strong>Phase 2: Hoarah Loux</strong> -- Hoarah fights bare-handed. Be very careful
                                        of his <strong>grab</strong> -- if he lifts his arms and charges, get the heck away;
                                        if he catches you, it's a suplex that deals massive damage. He does
                                        ground shockwave punches -- jump or roll those. He's very aggressive but
                                        somewhat predictable: lots of combo punches then a pause -- that's your
                                        opening. <strong>Mimic Tear</strong> helps immensely here by taking some hits or
                                        opening him for backstabs.

                                        Our bleed strategy still is effective; Hoarah can be bled. Two heavy
                                        weapons smashing him will stagger eventually. Watch stamina; his barrage
                                        can tempt panic rolling -- time your dodges to not run out of stamina.
                                        When he roars and does an earth-shattering stomp flurry, run out of
                                        range or spam roll with iframes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Defeat Hoarah Loux to receive <strong>Remembrance of Hoarah Loux</strong> (which
                                        can give his axe or an AoE stomp Ash of War).

                                        Now the path is clear into the <strong>Erdtree</strong> to confront the final boss.
                                        <strong>Take a moment:</strong> If you have any last things to do (e.g., you followed
                                        Ranni's quest and want to trigger her ending, ensure you gave her the
                                        Dark Moon Ring after Astel, so her summon sign will appear; or if you
                                        have Frenzied Flame and want to use Miquella's Needle to remove it for a
                                        different ending, you must do that at Dragonlord Placidusax arena now).
                                        You can still fast-travel anywhere in Ashen Capital even now, but once
                                        you enter the final arena and defeat the boss, the game will end (you
                                        can opt to remain in the world before starting NG+ though).
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Final Boss: Radagon of the Golden Order / Elden Beast:</strong> This is a
                                        two-part fight with no break in between. You must defeat Radagon, then
                                        immediately the Elden Beast, in one go (if you die to Elden Beast, you
                                        start back at Radagon).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Radagon of the Golden Order:</strong> Radagon has heavy holy damage and
                                        teleporting strikes. You cannot summon spirits for Radagon (but you
                                        <em>can</em> for Elden Beast -- however, a known bug sometimes prevents it, so
                                        consider summoning Mimic right as Radagon dies so it carries into Elden
                                        Beast fight). We'll assume solo Radagon, then summon at Elden Beast
                                        start.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Radagon's moves: massive hammer swings (dodge sideways), a grab (dodge
                                        back), ground holy explosions (roll right when the glow bursts). He
                                        often teleports mid-combo -- watch his reappearance flash to react. He
                                        is vulnerable to <strong>stance breaks</strong> -- jump attacks and heavy hits can
                                        stagger him for a critical hit. He's somewhat resistant to status
                                        (bleed/frost), but still possible to apply after many hits. Just focus
                                        on learning his timing. Use your <strong>Crimson Bubbletear</strong> in physick if
                                        you have, to survive a hit.

                                        With patience, Radagon falls. Immediately the <strong>Elden Beast</strong> spawns
                                        from his body.

                                        <strong>Elden Beast:</strong> This cosmic creature is large and fights in the arena
                                        of stars. You <em>can</em> summon your Mimic now (if it wasn't bugged -- try to
                                        do it as Beast spawns). The Beast uses holy attacks:

                                        A swimming sword slash (like a giant fly-by -- roll as it swings).

                                    <li>
                                        A homing constellation of golden rings (if you see a gold ring form
                                        around you, jump through it to avoid a damaging effect).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        A triple flame sword combo -- roll each hit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Most deadly: <strong>Elden Stars</strong> spell -- a tiny golden orb appears and
                                        starts chasing you, releasing a spray of projectiles over time. If you
                                        see this, <strong>sprint away and keep running</strong> -- it lasts long. Try to
                                        survive until it expires, as fighting while it's active is annoying.

                                        The Elden Beast's weakness: <strong>Black Knife Tiche</strong> summon works well as
                                        it dodges and does %HP damage, but if you didn't invest in that, Mimic
                                        is fine. Also, <strong>Elden Beast is weak to Bleed</strong>! Our bleed build shines
                                        here -- successive hits will chunk its health. Stay near its belly/tail
                                        -- many attacks go forward. Mount attacks when it's stationary, then
                                        when it swims away, chase with Torrent... oh wait, no Torrent here --
                                        you must hoof it.

                                    <li>
                                        Use pillars of ruined arena as cover from some projectiles if
                                        possible. Keep locking on -- sometimes camera can be an issue due to its
                                        size.

                                        <strong>Default ending (Age of Fracture/Elden Lord):</strong> Touch Fractured
                                        Marika and choose to mend the ring. You become Elden Lord in a fractured

                                        did Ranni's entire quest). Use it to summon Ranni and trigger the Age of

                                        <strong>Lord of Frenzied Flame:</strong> If you became the Lord of Frenzy (by
                                        meeting Three Fingers <em>and not using Miquella's Needle to cure it</em>), you

                                        the stone -- unleashing chaos. (If you have Frenzy and want a different
                                        ending, you <em>must</em> have used Miquella's Needle in Placidusax's arena to
                                        nullify it before beating final boss).

                                        have the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince, after beating boss you can

                                    latter being considered a "best" ending by many). For completeness: if
                                    you got Ranni's summon sign, that's a fan-favorite ending, so consider
                                    using it.

                                    After the credits, the game will ask if
                                    you want to begin <strong>Journey 2 (NG+)</strong> or stay in your current state. You
                                    can say "No" to NG+ to be put back at the Roundtable Hold in post-game
                                    -- this lets you still roam the world, finish any missed side content,
                                    or just PVP/coop. When ready, you can enter NG+ from the Table of Lost
                                    Grace or at a Site of Grace.

                                    This comprehensive walkthrough took you through
                                    Elden Ring's fastest (glitchless) route to story completion while also
                                    covering all major optional bosses and questlines. By prioritizing a
                                    bleed-focused build with high Dexterity and leveraging powerful weapons
                                    like the Bloodhound's Fang (upgraded through Smithing) and later the
                                    Rivers of Blood katana, we maintained excellent damage output and
                                    adaptability throughout the game. The guide highlighted efficient
                                    progression -- obtaining two Great Runes early (Godrick and Rennala) to
                                    access Leyndell, using key items like Margit's Shackle to ease boss
                                    fights, and minimizing backtracking by collecting medallions and quest
                                    items at opportune times.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Your character by endgame is an unstoppable force -- a testament to
                                    smart routing, optimized leveling (hitting key stat breakpoints for
                                    weapon requirements and damage), and effective use of summons and Ashes
                                    of War. From humbling Margit with an early +4 Bloodhound's Fang to
                                    conquering late-game bosses with dual-bleed power and the trusty Mimic
                                    Tear, you have risen to become Elden Lord (or perhaps something even
                                    greater...).
                                </p>

                                    We hope this guide made your first journey through the Lands Between a
                                    thrilling and manageable adventure. There is still much in Elden Ring to
                                    explore -- alternate builds, secrets (did you find all the legendary
                                    armaments and sorceries?), and perhaps future DLC. But for now, enjoy
                                    the well-earned triumph of beating Elden Ring! <strong>Long may you bask in
                                    your victory, Tarnished.</strong>

                                <li>Start with the Samurai class for an excellent early-game weapon (Uchigatana) that scales with Dexterity and causes bleed damage.</li>
                                <li>Focus early points on Vigor (health) to avoid being one-shot by bosses. Aim for 20-25 Vigor by mid-game and 35-40 by end-game.</li>
                                <li>Grab Bloodhound's Fang from the Forlorn Hound Evergaol in Limgrave as soon as possible - it's one of the best weapons in the game.</li>
                                <li>Use Torrent for mobility in open areas and to escape dangerous situations.</li>
                                <li>Spirit Ashes like the Mimic Tear can significantly help in boss fights by drawing aggro.</li>
                                <li>Bleed weapons are extremely effective against most enemies and bosses, as they deal percentage-based damage.</li>
                                <li>Don't hoard your Golden Runes - use them to level up when needed, especially before boss fights.</li>
                                <li>Use the Flask of Wondrous Physick with tear combinations that complement your playstyle.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="card__title">Advanced Strategies</h2>
                            <ul class="feature-list feature-list--strategies">
                                <li>Jump attacks with heavy weapons deal substantial poise damage and can stagger enemies for critical hits.</li>
                                <li>Stack complementary talismans - Lord of Blood's Exultation (damage boost on bleed) pairs perfectly with bleed weapons.</li>
                                <li>Use Godrick's Great Rune (+5 to all stats) or Radahn's Great Rune (HP/stamina boost) for challenging areas.</li>
                                <li>When facing difficult bosses, prioritize survival over damage - focus on learning attack patterns before getting aggressive.</li>
                                <li>For ultra-hard bosses like Malenia, consider temporarily respeccing to a specific counter-build (frost+bleed works well).</li>
                                <li>Status effects stack in Elden Ring - dual-wielding bleed weapons can trigger hemorrhage twice as quickly.</li>
                                <li>Use the Mimic Tear strategically - it copies your current equipment, so equip healing items before summoning.</li>
                                <li>When exploring new areas, prioritize finding map fragments and Sites of Grace to establish fast travel points.</li>
